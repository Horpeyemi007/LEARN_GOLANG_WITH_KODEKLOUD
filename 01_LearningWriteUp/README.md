### GOLANG INTRODUCTION

`GO` was created to combine the ease of programming of an interpreted dynamically typed language like (python), including with the efficiency & safety of a statistically typed, compiled language like (c++).

**"Packages"** are `GO` ways of organizing and reusing code, as every `GO` programme must start with the package declaration. This include the "package" keyword and the name of the package. e.g `package main`.

We also use the `import` keyword to include code from other packages to use with the programme.
